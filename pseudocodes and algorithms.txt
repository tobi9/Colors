pseudocode for color customization system
There's a palette that is to be displayed whenever the box or text intended to be changed is tapped
the code checks if the player wants to change the color of the box or text then loads the palette. The palette checks the
colors for those that have been unlocked by the player and dynamically creates box nodes for those colors. When the player 
chooses the intended colour the the address and color are loaded into a function(todo) which sets the color and and saves 
it.

Algorithm for the customization collection:
-- for the palette
	load the colors and check their unlocked status
	-- keep in mind the colors are tables with a string, boolean value and vector4 number
	load the colors that are unlocked into a local table unlkd_clrs
	for k, v in unlkd_clrs do
		create a text and box node a set them to their appropriate values
		load the nodes created into two tables for the box and text nodes respectively
	end
	on choosing the colour, the correct memory address of the node that is to be changed is loaded and the vector4 
	value of the colour is saved. the text node that aligns with the box node is set to "picked" or a tick. There's
	also a default button which sets the color to the default color of that type of node. 
-- for the general colour customization system
	when the customization collection is loaded, the player gets to pick the collection they want to customize.The
	customizable form of the collection is loaded, the player then chooses the node they would like to customize, then
	an option asking the player wether to customize the text or the box is shown and when the the picks their 
	preferred option then the pallete is loaded
-- the technique used to accomplish the objectives of the customization system
NOTE prefix each memory location in the customization system with the name of the collection of the node that uses
it
